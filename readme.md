# Java Exiftool
Exiftool info in java.

## What?
This project provides a wrapper for those who need to get information from exiftool in their java software.
It provides a simple yet powerful querying interface.

## Who?
This wrapper should be usable by any java developer with a couple of years of experience.

## Why?
We were in need of a java wrapper for exiftool ourselves but found that 
[the most popular wrapper] (https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/exiftool) had been discontinued.
